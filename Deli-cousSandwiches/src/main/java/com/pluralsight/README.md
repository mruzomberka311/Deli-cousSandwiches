# Deli-Cous Sandwich Shop

## Description of the Project
In this project, the goal is to make an interactive sandwich shop where a customer may order a fully customizable sandwich.Sandwiches can range in size,
premium toppings, and other included toppings each with a different price based on the size. To help navigate this challenge, some classes integrated
inheritance and abstract classes. The entire process required creating an order, allowing the customer to add to a list of sandwiches, drinks, and chips and then
totaling the price in the end. The receipt that displays the orders contents on the screen and also saves it to a separate file. Overall, the project simulates
a basic POS system.

## User Stories

- As a customer, I would like to be able to have a clear menu of sandwich additions, so I can customize my sandwich.
- As a customer, I would like to add items to my order, and see the total price.
- As a user, I would like to print and save the receipt of a checked out order, so I can have a history of orders.
- As a user I would like to be able to have an efficient way of ordering in case it gets busy.

## Future Work

- I would have liked to have integrated Enums to simplify the project further.
- Instead of a random order number, have the order number count by 1 and reset every time it reaches 100.
- Overall, I would have liked to make the receipt look nicer.
